## What is Spatial Autocorrelation

Spatial autocorrelation measures the variation of a variable by taking an
observation and seeing how similar or different it is compared to other
observations within its neighborhood [[1]](#1). In other words,
it measures wether and how much nearby observations influence each other.

In real estate, properties close to each other often whare similar
characteristics (e.g. neighborhood quality, amenities) and thus may have similar
prices.

### Interpretation

Similar to traditional correlation measures, spatial autocorrelation values go
from -1 to 1. Positive spatial autocorrelation results when observations within
a neighborhood have similar values, either high-high (HH) values or low-low (LL)
values. Negative spatial autocorrelation is a result of having low values next
to high values, or viceversa. [[1]](#1)

![Positive and negative spatial autocorrelation example](/images/masters_thesis/autocorrelation/pn_spat_autoc.png)

In the figure above, we can see three sets of data.
* The first has a high value
cluster in the bottom and a lower value cluster in the top. Since most of
the points are high values, it would return a HH positive spatial
autocorrelation.
* The second set of data is the same but inverted, more lower
values, therefore it would have a LL positive autocorrelation
* The third one has low values surrounded by high values (and the other way
around), so it would return a negative spatial autocorrelation and, depending
on the number of Low-High (LH) and High-Low (HL) relationships, it would return
one of them.

## Global and local spatial autocorrelation

Spatial autocorrelation is measured in 2 ways: Global and Local.

* **Global**: Measures the trend in an overall dataset, it helps to understand
the degree of spatial clustering present.

* **Local**: Measures the localized variation in the dataset and helps detect
the presence of hot spots or cold spots
    * **Hot spots**: Localized area clustes with statistically significant high
    values
    * **Cold spots** Localized area clustes with statistically significant lower
    values

## Spatial weights

To define the neighborhood of a given observation (i.e. in the real estate data,
which are the properties considered 'neighbors' of another), 
**spatial weights matrices** are used. There are three main spatial weights
matrices: rook contiguity matrix, queen contiguity matrix and K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN) matrix.

![Spatial weigths matrices](/images/masters_thesis/autocorrelation/spatial_weights_matrices.png)

### Rook contiguity matrix

* Takes the four nearest neighbors in a north (N), south (S), east (E), and
west (W) direction.
* Named after the *rook* chess pice since it follows the same directions.

### Queen contiguity matrix

* Takes the eight nearest neighbors in N, NE, NW, S, SE, SW, W and E directions
* In a similar fashion to how a *queen* moves about a chessboard.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

* Takes the closest $k$ neighbors in any direction.
* Uses the Euclidean distance

The weight is used for the spatial autocorrelation testings and depending on
the used matrix it could yield different results.

## Spatial lags

A spatial lag is a byproduct of the spatial weights matrix. A spatial lag is a
variable that averages the values of the nearest neighbors, as defined by the
spatial weights matrix chosen.

For example, in real estate, the spatial lag of a property using KNN (k=5) when
we're interested in the selling price would be the average selling price of the
5 closest properties.

## Testing for Spatial Autocorrelation

The measures (test statistics) related to the existence of global and local
spatial autocorrelation in data are defined as:
* **Global indicators of spatial association (GISA)**
* **Local indicators of spatial association (LISA)**:

### Testing for Global Spatial Autocorrelation

The most common measures used to test the existence of spatial autocorrelation
[[2]](#2) in the data are Moran's I [[3]](#3) and Geary's C [[4]](#4). The
null and alternative hypotheses for these tests are [[1]](#1):

* $H_0$: The data is distributed randomly across space
* $H_a$: The data exhibits a spatial structure and is not randomly distributed

#### Monran's I

$$Moran's\ I = \frac{N}{S_0} \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N} w(i,j)(x_i - \bar{x})(x_j - \bar{x})}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}$$

Where:
* $(x_i - \bar{x})$: the standardized value of the variable of interest (voi)
* $(x_j - \bar{x})$: the standardized value of the lag of the voi
* $\bar{x}$: mean of the voi
* $N$: number of features
* $S_0$ the aggregate of spatial weights

Moran's I ranges from -1 to +1. A positive value indicates positive spatial
autocorrelation and a negative value indicates negative spatial autocorrelation.
Values near zero suggest a random spatial pattern.

#### Geary's C

$$Geary's\ C = \frac{(N-1)}{2S_0} \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N} w(i,j)(x_i - x_j)}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}$$

Geary's C ranges from 0 to 2. A value less than 1 indicates positive spatial
autocorrelation, a value greater than 1 indicates negative spatial
autocorrelation, and a value of 1 suggests a rnadom spatial pattern.

### Statistics for Local Spatial Autocorrelation

Local spatial autocorrelation measures the relationship between each observation
and its localized surroundings. Compared to global spatial autocorrelation,
local spatial autocorrelation does not return a single value but instead
returns values per observation.

**Local Indicators of Spatial Associations (LISAs)** are spatial statistics that
are derived from global spatial statistics and calculate local cluster pattern,
also known as spatial outliers.

Similar to the GISAs, there is a Local Moran statistic and a Local Geary
statistic [[5]](#5). <!-- proposed by Anselin, L. (1995) -->

#### Local Moran's I

$$I_i = \frac{x_i - \bar{y}}{m_2} \sum_{j} w(i,j)(x_j - \bar{x})$$

Where

* $m_2$ is a constant defined as $m_2 = N^{-1} \sum_{i}(x_i - \bar{x})$
* $(x_i - \bar{x})$: the standardized value of the variable of interest (voi)
* $(x_j - \bar{x})$: the standardized value of the lag of the voi
* $\bar{x}$: mean of the voi
* $N$: number of features

#### Local Geary's C

$$C_i = \frac{1}{m_2} \sum_{j} w(i,j)(x_i - x_j)$$


## Spatial Autocorrelation in Guadalajara

Now moving on to the Guadalajara and Zapopan properties dataset. We will test
global and local spatial autocorrelation for the following variables: price per mÂ²
(target variable), number of bedrooms, parking spaces, pool (yes/no), number
of full and half bathrooms, property age, type (appartment/house).

### Global Spatial Autocorrelation

The following tables shows the results of the Global Spatial Autocorrelation
tests using a KNN (k=5) based matrix.

| Variable        |   Morans I |   Morans p-value |   Gearys C |   Gearys p-value |
|:----------------|-----------:|-----------------:|-----------:|-----------------:|
| price_per_m2    |   0.562456 |            0.001 |   0.434739 |            0.001 |
| bedrooms        |   0.265306 |            0.001 |   0.729518 |            0.001 |
| parking_spaces  |   0.447566 |            0.001 |   0.548583 |            0.001 |
| pool            |   0.309398 |            0.001 |   0.697403 |            0.001 |
| full_bathroom   |   0.382512 |            0.001 |   0.605439 |            0.001 |
| half_bathroom   |   0.185348 |            0.001 |   0.803326 |            0.001 |
| property_age    |   0.236803 |            0.001 |   0.736967 |            0.001 |
| gated_community |   0.476967 |            0.001 |   0.520659 |            0.001 |
| type_Appartment |   0.522861 |            0.001 |   0.480085 |            0.001 |

For each of the statistics calculated, all variables exhibited a spatial
structure that is statistically significant, as shown in the table.

The plot below shows the Moran's I statistic for the properites in Guadalajara
and Zapopan. Each point represents a property and it's relationship with the
5 nearest properties (spatial lag).

![Moran plot of prices in Guadalajara-Zapopan](/images/masters_thesis/autocorrelation/moranplot_price_gdl.png)

The points in the upper right quadrant have positive spatial autocorrelation,
while the points in the lower left quadrant have negative spatial
autocorrelation. A line of best fit, shaded red, is overlayed on the plot to
show the strength of the relationship. Here, the relationship appears to be
reasonably strong, as the points are distributed above and below the line of
best fit to roughly the same degree.

### Local Spatial Autocorrelation

Here, the LISA for the price variable was calculated using the Local Moran's I
statistic. This means that the Moran's I was calculated for each point of the
dataset with a KNN (k=5) based matrix. In the image below we can see the
distribution of the Moran's I Local test results:

![Autocorrelation by neighborhood in Guadalajara and Zapopan](/images/masters_thesis/autocorrelation/morans_local_gdl.png)

From the distribution, we can see that there is a massive spike in the data
around 0 with a long right tail. This is mainly due to the presence of a large
number of observations with positive spatial autocorrelation, which is in line
with what we discovered from the global measures.

### LISA Clusters by Neighborhood

Finally, the LISA results were used to visualize if:
* There exists statistically significant spatial autocorrelation within the
properties of each neighborhood and
* What quadrant (HH, LL, HL, LH) do these properties belong in their majority

![Autocorrelation by neighborhood in Guadalajara and Zapopan](/images/masters_thesis/autocorrelation/gdl_spatial_autocorrelation.png)

The map above, shows the neighborhoods where there exist a concentration of HH,
HL, LH and LL clusters based on the price per mÂ².
* It can be seen that there
are areas without any significant spatial autocorrelation (grey),
* but that there
are neighborhoods where most of the properties have either high (HH) prices or
low (LL) prices and, between them,
* neighborhoods that have both Low and High properties.
    * In yellow are the neighborhoods where there are more High-priced (HL)
    properties and
    * in light blue neighborhoods where there are more Low-priced (LH)
    properties.

## Conclusion

Guadalajara and Zapopan properties exhibit spatial autocorrelation in most of
their variables: with HH clusters from West to East in the center of the
metropolitan area and LL clusters in the outskirts; along with some neighborhoods
in between with either LL or HL clusters.

Besides the price per mÂ², the other variables also are significantly spatially
autocorrelated, which indicates that similar houses (in size, age and
characteristics) tend to be clustered around certain areas.

This has to be taken into consideration when choosing and fitting a Machine
Learning model, since traditional models such as linear regression will return
biased results. Models that can incorporate spatial proximity features have
to be used instead.
