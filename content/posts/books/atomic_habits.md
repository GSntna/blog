Atomic Habits by ...

## Introduction

* A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly - and in many
cases, automatically
* Changes that seem small and unimportant at first, will compound into remarkable
results if you're willing to stick with them for years.

## The surprising power of atomic habits

* Habits are the compound interest of self improvement. Every day counts for a
lot in the long run
    * Getting 1% better each day will make you ~38% better after one year.
    * Getting 1% worse each day, will decrease your performance to ~0% after one year.
* Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you.
* Small changes appear to make no difference until you cross a critical
threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed.
Patience is key. Example of critical threshold:
    * raising the temperature 1 degree at a time unti an ice cube starts melting
    * tectonic plates that have been coliding from years until one day they 
    produce an earthquake.
* Atomic habits are little habits that are part of a larger system. They build
the blocks of remarkable results.
* For better results, forget about setting goals and focus on building a system
instead.
* "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your
sytems.

## How your habits shape your identity.

* The 3 levels of change:
    1. **Outcome** eg. stop procrastinating
    2. **Process** eg. define a schedule
    3. **Identity** eg. "I am a productive person"
* The most effective way is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on
who you wish to become. Eg. instead of saying "No thanks, I'm trying to quit
smoking", say "No thanks, I'm not a smoker"; focus on the identity.
* Your identity emerges out of your habits, every action is a vote for the type
of person you wish to become. Everytime you perform a good or bad habit, it's a
vote that reinforces your identity. If you procrastinate, you are voting for
"I am a procrastinator", if you do your tasks it is a vote for "I am productive".
In the end, the goal is that the majority of votes define you as the person that
you want to be.
* Becoming the best version of yourself requires to continiously edit your
beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
* The real reason many habits matter is not because they can get you better
results (although the can do that), but because they can change your beliefs
about yourself. Going from Identity to Outcome instead of the other way around,
is the best way of creating good habits and removing bad ones.
